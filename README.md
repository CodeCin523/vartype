# vartype (or shitty database)

`vartype` is a lightweight memory allocator library that allows you to access variables from anywhere in your application, as long as you have the correct name and page. This library is designed to simplify variable management in complex systems, enabling efficient memory usage and easy variable retrieval.

**Note:** The current implementation of `vartype` is more of a proof of concept than a fully optimized solution. It may not perform as well as other approaches and is intended primarily for educational purposes and experimentation.

## Features

- Register and manage variables across different pages.
- Access variables using their names and associated pages.
- Retrieve parent and child relationships between pages and variables.
- Flexible and easy-to-use API.
